# Nutab New Tab Replacer
Beautifully simple new tab replacer for Chrome

## Description
Nutab replaces the new tab page with a beautiful daily photograph, sourced from the free and incredible unSplash API. 

### Permissions
#### Bookmarks
Similar to the default new tab page, this extension will bring you access to your bookmarks. For Nutab to access your bookmarks, Nutab requests bookmarks permission access to read and display your bookmarks. The extension will not make modifications to your bookmarks.

### Icons
To add a touch of style to bookmarks, the bookmarks bar is represented by icons without labels. It can happen that bookmarked sites are familiarised by their icons, thus speeding up navigation. For the extension to have the ability to display these icons, this permission is requested from you. It will only ever grab the icon of the relative bookmark.
